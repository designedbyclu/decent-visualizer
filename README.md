Visualizer your coffee shots created by [Decent Espresso Machine](https://decentespresso.com/), [Smart Espresso Profiler](https://www.naked-portafilter.com/product-category/smart-espresso-profiler/), [Pressensor](https://pressensor.com/), [Beanconqueror](https://beanconqueror.com/), and others.

Read all about it on [visualizer.coffee](https://visualizer.coffee/), and feel free to [join the forum](https://decentforum.com/tag/visualizer).

Application monitoring is sponsored by [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com/visualizer/admin/api_keys).

## API

There is an API available. If something you would like is not there, please open a new [Issue](https://github.com/miharekar/decent-visualizer/issues/) detailing your wishes.

You can read [the source code](/app/controllers/api) or [the API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2402164/UVC2HUik) provided by [@eriklenaerts](https://github.com/eriklenaerts).

Authenticatication is possible via [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/authorization-code/) with `read`, `upload`, and `write` scopes.
The difference between `upload` and `write` is that `upload` is **only** for uploading shots, and `write` is for everything. This enables you to have a "low danger" scope, so that even if a token is stolen, the worst that can happen is that the attacker can upload shots. But they won't be able to delete them.
All endpoints return JSON.

If you want to create OAuth applications please [contact me](mailto:miha@mr.si).

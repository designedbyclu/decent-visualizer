# [Decent Visualizer](https://visualizer.coffee/)

![Ruby Tests](https://github.com/miharekar/decent-visualizer/actions/workflows/ruby-tests.yml/badge.svg)

A visualizer for `.shot` files created by the [Decent Espresso Machine](https://decentespresso.com/).

Visualizer is a relatively standard [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application with a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## API

There is a basic API available. If you can read Rails, [this should be pretty self-explanatory](app/controllers/api/shots_controller.rb).

Endpoints available:

- index on `/api/shots/`. Accepts `limit` and `offset` params. Returns authenticated user's or public (if not authenticated) shots ordered by when the shot was created.
- download on `/api/shots/[shot_id]/download`. Accepts `essentials` param. Returns all of the data of the `[shot_id]` shot. If the `essentials` param has any value, it omits data and timeframe values.
- profile on `/api/shots/[shot_id]/download`. Returns the `tcl` profile file of the shot.
- shared on `/api/shots/shared`. Requires `code` param. Returns the shot that is being shared via the 4-character code.
- upload on `/api/shots/upload`. Requires `file` param containing `tcl` (`.shot`) or `JSON` file of the shot. Returns uploaded shot's ID if parsing is successful. Must be authenticated.

Authenticatication is possible via [Basic access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with email and password.

All endpoints return JSON.
